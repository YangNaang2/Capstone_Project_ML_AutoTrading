# Capstone Project: Machine Learning for Automated Trading (UpBit)

**2024 Fall & 2025 Spring**

## üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing and optimizing **automated trading strategies** using **UpBit API**. Several traditional strategies are programmed and then backtested using the Python library **Backtrader** to assess their effectiveness. Additionally, machine learning models such as **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** and **GRU (Gated Recurrent Units)** are used to predict price movements, with performance evaluations to determine their viability for trading.

The ultimate goal is to integrate the strategies with the UpBit API for real-time automated trading.
